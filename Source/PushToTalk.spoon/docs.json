When my conference application starts\nPushToTalk activate `push-to-talk` mode. In this mode I'm muted\nand I need to pres `fn` key to temporaty unmute myself.\nAlso I have keybindings to easyly switch from `push-to-talk` to `release-to-talk` mode, in case I'm active speaker.\n\nPushToTalk has menubar with icons so when you see red circle - you shod know you're unmuted.\n\nThis is my config: `spoon.SpoonInstall:andUse(\"PushToTalk\", {start = true, config = { app_switcher = { ['zoom.us'] = 'push-to-talk' }}})` \nand binding for this `function() spoon.PushToTalk.toggleStates({'push-to-talk', 'release-to-talk'}) end`",
